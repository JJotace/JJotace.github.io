# 4.4 Monitoring

## Introduction

AppDynamics is used for the monitoring of applications, servers and databases within the company. There is currently a lack of monitoring over the oracle databases, which need to be created by the few teams that count with somebody with the knowledge and rights to do so. To facilitate anybody being able to create a database collector and being able to better support the application teams running their app-facing application data in them, the project's playbook is in charge of quickly deploying collectors to AppDynamics with a curl command.

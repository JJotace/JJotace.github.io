# Summary & Reflection

## 1. Project Review

The goals for this project have been successfully met. The automation of the playbook has been presented to the organization and is already being used to onboard new Oracle database collectors onto AppDynamics with much less manual work. Several of these databases have been looked into and had indexes added to make their transactions faster, which helps improve the end user's experience.

The project has shown real value by making a previously manual process much smoother and creating a good foundation for future database monitoring improvements.


## 2. Lessons Learnt

- **Better Communication**: I could have communicated better with work peers who were also involved on AppDynamics topics. This might have helped me see coming issues like the structure changes that ended up costing me extra time that was supposed to be dedicated for the project documentation.

- **Visual Documentation**: Taking screenshots or recording videos of where the project was at different stages would have made the sprint reviews much better and more complete. It would have helped actually see the progress made, rather than just reading about it.


## 3. Final Assessment

The project showed the importance of automating. There are many daily processes or tasks that are still being done by hand, having made a project around automation has helped easily spot possible points of improvement within the company. A lot has been learnt too in this topic. In the future, Postgres could be added to the automation to, which currently only supports Oracle, to further help offer the end user a better experience using the company products.

## 4. Personal Summary

I am honestly really proud that my first project has been something my company can actually use and benefit from. When I first had to come up with a topic for this project, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to work on. I've recently started working with AppDynamics, which is our monitoring tool, and I was given the task of looking into our Oracle databases and onboarding as many as possible. The timing couldn't have been betterâ€”I noticed this was a fairly straightforward manual process that could be automated, so I decided to go for it.

This project was full of firsts for me. I had never worked with Ansible before, never been in charge of a whole project, and never had to take full responsibility for a technical solution. The learning curve was pretty steep, but it was worth it. Since I am always helping with application deployments and supporting teams when things go wrong, getting hands-on experience with Ansible has been really valuable for my job.

Issues will appear for every project, no matter how well things have been planned and analyzed, is what I have learnt. I have had to troubleshoot and work under pressure a lot, while still not fully confident in my ansible skills, which has probably been the biggest factor in me learning more about it, so I am glad nothing was perfect.

Something else I learnt was documenting, specially in markdown format and with git, which I have never done before. This first semester project was full of first times for me.

I am really happy with how the project turned out and I am excited to take what I have learned into future projects while continuing to explore new technologies. This experience has made me even more interested in automation and process improvement, which are areas I definitely want to keep developing in my career.

# Jira

Jira makes it easy to have a project overview through Scrum and Kanban boards, as well as monitoring the progress made.

The Kanban board displays the status of each task as it progresses through the sprint:

| To Do (Open)         | In Progress              | Done (Completed)         |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tasks that are yet to be started | Tasks currently being worked on | Tasks that have been completed |

This visual workflow helps the team quickly identify bottlenecks and maintain a steady pace.

## Task Fields

Each task in Jira includes several key fields to support organization and prioritization:

| Field      | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Tag        | Unique identifier or label for the task       |
| Assignee   | Person responsible for completing the task    |
| Status     | Current state (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)|
| Epic       | High-level feature or initiative grouping tasks|
| Start Date | Date when work on the task begins            |
| End Date   | Target or actual completion date             |
| Priority   | Importance level (e.g., High, Medium, Low)   |
| Sprint     | The sprint to which the task is assigned      |
| Stories    | User stories or requirements addressed by the task |

This structured approach ensures transparency, accountability, and effective sprint planning.

By leveraging Jira's boards and detailed task fields, teams can maintain clarity, focus on priorities, and continuously improve their workflow.

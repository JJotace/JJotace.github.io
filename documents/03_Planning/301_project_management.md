# 3.1 Project Management

For this project, I chose to combine aspects of both Scrum and Kanban, using Jira as my project management tool. 

With Kanban, I can easily visualize all the tasks on a board, making it simple to spot where work is piling up or moving too slow. This helps with adding new tasks or change priorities anytime, so that if an urgent change comes up, I can adapt my workflor without disrupting the rest of the planning.


Combining this with Scrum's structure, planning work in Sprints and reviewing the progress regularly creates a balance  between planning and being able to react to changes quickly. Jira supports this by allowing the updating of the board, moving tasks between columns and tracking progress in real time.

## Sprint

Sprints are periods of time, usually between 1 to 4 weeks, in which a specific part of the project's work is completed and reviewed. Sprints contain the following phases:

- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective.

These phases ensure the quality and structure of the sprint.

## Sprint Planning

The tasks within the backlog are assigned to the different sprints. These tasks must be completed during the sprint period, as commited by the individual during the planning.

## Daily Scrum

A daily scrum is a short meeting that is carried everyday, at the same time. This helps identifying issues in time, as well as monitoring the current sprint progress. Although this project is carried out by just one person, a daily scrum will still take place in the form of a quick self check in. During this time, the following questions will be made:

- What was accomplished yesterday?
- What will be done today?
- Are there any issues or blockers?

This routine will help with staying focused, tracking progress and quickly addressing any challenges that come up during the sprint.

## Sprint review

At the end of each sprint, there will be a review to check the progress and quality of the sprints, checking if the tasks assigned were completed in time.

## Sprint Retrospective

A sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint, during which the just-completed sprint is reflected upon. This is not a review of the sprint, as mentioned earlier, but rather serves to assess and discuss how the team worked together, including which processes, tools, and practices were used.

During the retrospective these points are made:

- What went well during the sprint
- What did not go well or could be improved
- What changes will be implemented on the next sprint, if any, to improve the quality and effectiveness

## Kanban

Kanban is a visual workflow management method that centers around the philosophy of continuous improvement. Kanban organizes the different items and goals from the project into a board, in which the team can easily visualize what is yet to be done, what is work in progress and what is done. This approach helps easily identify the status of each task and idenfity bottlenecks.

## Why Scrum

For this project, I chose to use Scrum because it’s an approach we recently had the opportunity to learn about in school. I wanted to further develop my skills and deepen my understanding of the topic, which is why I decided to use it.

I have also seen firsthand that Agile methods like Scrum are commonly used in real-world projects, including at my workplace, where we use tools like Jira to manage our work. To better align myself with my company’s practices and become a more valuable member of my team, I felt Scrum was the most effective choice to help me progress faster and contribute more effectively.

# 3.5 Risk Management



## 3.5.1 Risk Management handling

To manage the project risks, weekly meetings are held to review the current risk matrix and discuss any possible changes or new problems that might have come up. During these meetings, the risk likely-hood is reassesed to see if something within the project needs to be changed, or what the best course of action is in case any of these risks were to actually affect the project. This regular review helps with proactivity and helps adjusting plans quickly to minimize negative effects on the project and stay within the deadline.

# Introduction

AppDynamics is an essential monitoring tool used at UBS to ensure the optimal performance and reliability of our applications and infrastructure. It provides comprehensive insights into application behavior, enabling proactive management and quick resolution of issues.

This tool is essential for the monitoring of applications, servers and databases, which count with health policies that send out tickets and e-mails whenever an alert such as memory goes above a certain use percentage. This helps quickly react in case of anything going wrong.
 
UBS currently uses AppDynamics for the monitoring of all of our applications, servers and databases.

At the moment, we do not count with an overview for our oracle databases, and is currently a manual process that is very costly in time for our busy support teams. This makes it so that in case of issues, we are late to timely react, leading to a worse experience for the end user, which directly goes against our organization's aim.

As part of this semester project, the process of creating database collectors in our monitoring platform will be analyzed and automated. The goal is to write an ansible playbook that automates this manual process, saving our supporters time and offering the end user a better experience by very quickly setting the monitoring of all of our databases.
 
This project will describe both the challenges and solutions that may come up during the development of an anisble playbook, while being limited by our own infrastructure and policies within UBS.
